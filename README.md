Hidden Adventures iOS Application

This is a full-featured iOS application that will soon be available in the Apple App-Store. It allows people to share interesting and unique destinations with yours friends. The app is geo-location enabled so you can find "adventures" that are close to your current location. Share hidden locations with just your friends or make them public for everyone. You can rate these adventures and flag them as favorites.
